# MonkeyPox Disease Analysis
This is an exploratory analysis of the MonkeyPox disease affecting our world today.
The analysis was made with the Structured Query Language (SQL). 

For the analysis I made use of two(2) datasets, which I properly labelled in the SQL Query.

I had a general overview of the data before carrying out the cleaning process.

I cleaned the dataset by changing the Date Column from a datetime to a date function.

For the analysis I carried out a series of operations with SQL Queries:
  1. Highest Deaths for each Country.
  2. Percentage of the Total Deaths to the Total Cases for each Country.
  3. New cases for each location.
  4. Total Cases and Total Deaths for each Country.
  5. Total MonkeyPox Cases in the World.
  6. Highest Cases Per Million.

There were NULL values in the data, but it had no effect on the analysis.

For the second dataset, I carried out the following operations:
  1. Confirmed Cases for each Country.
  2. Hospitalized Cases vs Confirmed Cases for each Country.
  3. Travel History for each country.
  
 There were NULL values in the data, but it had no effect on the analysis
