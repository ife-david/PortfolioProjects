# Data Exploration on Covid19
This project was basically a data exploration project on the Covid19 disease ravaging our world.

I began by getting a general overview of the data and ordered the data using the location and date column.

I decided to find out the total number of cases and deaths in my country , NIGERIA.

I further conducted an analysis of the countries that had the Highest Infection Rate in comparison with their population.

For better analysis, I calculated the total deaths for each continent and for each country as well.

I decided to use the JOINS function to join the two tables, on the basis of location and date to calculate the variation of the total population with the amount of people vaccinated.

In order to create virtual tables(CTE), which i used to do some quick analysis after which it terminates.

I created temporary tables and populated it with data for analysis.

Lastly, I complied the necessary data in a view, which I used for visualisation in Tableau.
